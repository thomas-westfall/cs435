The first thing I did was check to see if the data I had was in 1st normal form or not. On inspection of each dataset, I realized that all five contained longitude and latitude pairs, but were encapsulated together within parentheses as a pair in a singular column. I decided to split this pair up into two separate attributes: latitude and longitude, in order to put the datasets into 1st normal form. 

After this, I realized that these five datasets shared many attributes in common, such as name, status, location, latitude, longitude, etc. I decided that it would be a good idea to put these shared attributes into a single table to maximize efficiency. Doing a bit of research on how to do this, I stumbled onto the concepts of supertyping and subtyping. With these concepts in mind, I decided it would be best to generalize the five datasets into one table of places, where the most general of information would be stored. To be more specific, attributes that all of them shared would be stored here. Specialized information for each place would be held in their respective table. To link these tables with each other, I added an ID as the primary key for places, which can then be used as the primary key/foriegn key in the specialized tables.
